Hi there 👋, I'm Salim Ahmed
🚀 Full Stack Developer
👨‍💻 Self-taught developer based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia💻 Passionate about crafting modern, scalable web applications with cutting-edge technologies.🌍 Graduate of the intensive Evangadi Tech Bootcamp, where I built real-world projects like Netflix clones, forums, and more.

👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a dedicated full stack developer with a strong foundation in web development, honed through the rigorous Evangadi Tech Bootcamp. There, I mastered full stack technologies from the ground up, including React, Node.js, Express, MySQL, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and MongoDB.
During the bootcamp, I collaborated with developers worldwide to build scalable, real-world projects like Netflix, Amazon, and Apple clones, as well as dynamic forums. These experiences taught me not just how to code, but how the web truly works—from frontend rendering to backend logic, databases, APIs, and deployment.
I thrive on tackling new challenges, building powerful web applications, and continuously expanding my skill set through hands-on projects.
